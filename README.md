### Key Technology: DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit)

DPDK is a set of libraries and drivers that allow high-speed packet processing by bypassing the operating systemâ€™s kernel. Normally, when data packets arrive at a computer, they go through the OS kernel, adding processing delay. DPDK allows applications to process packets directly from the network interface card (NIC) in user space, significantly reducing latency.

#### Using DPDK can help in:
- **Faster Data Transmission**: Reducing network delays for market data updates and order execution.
- **Lower CPU Overhead**: Avoiding unnecessary kernel processing steps.
- **Higher Throughput**: Handling large volumes of market data efficiently.
